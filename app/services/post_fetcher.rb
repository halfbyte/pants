# `PostFetcher` will fetch a post from a remote URL and store it in the local
# database.
#
# In theory, it could refuse to do its job for post URLs that look like they
# live on the current instance; however, we must take the situation into account
# that a user moves their site to a new instance without having their `User#hosted`
# reset to false in the old instance (ie. the user is now remote, without this
# instance knowing it.)
#
# In addition to fetching the post, `PostFetcher` will add the post to the timelines
# of local followers of the post's author.
